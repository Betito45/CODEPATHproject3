# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Alberto Doroteo-Reyes**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Name of your app** is an android app that was riddle with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  **FoxChat is a app where Foxes can send pictures, messages, and videos on to communicate with eachother**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ‘Œâœ”ðŸ˜Š**
